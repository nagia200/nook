## About
Nook is a mobile-friendly, single page web application that finds nearby study spots -- including coffee shops and public libraries -- based on the user's location. This was a short project for me to practice working with AngularJS and the Google Maps Javascript API.

## Features
The user can search by address, city, or place using the Google Autocomplete input box. The app then displays each study spot along with a photo, whether it is currently open or not, link to the Google url (for directions or more detailed information), and website, if applicable.

## Future Features
* Add more study locations (i.e. public parks)
* Sort by study location type
